# Counting Solar Adoption: Computer Vision to Track Solar Panels on Rooftops

This computer vision project combines two models: a segmentation model for identifying solar panels on rooftops and a detection model for locating and analyzing rooftops. It also includes counting, which tracks rooftop with and without solar panels to provide insights into adoption rates across regions.
